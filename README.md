# Responsive-Website

The goal of this project was to create a responsive website, where the page reacts depending on if it is monitor, tablet or smartphone sized.
It also has my first utilization of JavaScript (click the hamburger button in either the tablet or phone setting) in cooperation with HTML5 and CSS.
This project was completed following along with Daniel Walter Scott's course "The best course for learning the basics of HTML5 and CSS3 from scratch. Including 5 projects, perfect for beginners." from Udemy. 

This project was great to see how fully understand what a responsive website is. To best see the implimentation, Open Live Server on index.html, open 'inspect', 'toggle device toolbar' and you will be able to see the page transition accordingly.
